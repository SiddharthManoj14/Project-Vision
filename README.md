Codes for glove that is to be integrated with the Headset along with some other misc. codes.

The glove is something that can be used as a wearable mouse and can control the cursor. It can also be used to play classic FPS games like CSGO and Call of Duty.

Future plans include to make the glove accept and send feedback.

<b>For mimicing resistance we plan on using an array of DC motors attached to each finger.
  
  Circuit diagram and code will be updated soon.
